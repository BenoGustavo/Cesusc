> This repository has the exercises from my college classes.

## 💻 Directories

The directories will have the same name as the class, inside them will have the exercises.

- [✓] Linux 🐧
- [✓] Windows 🪟

## 🚀 How to run:

Just use the language compiler i think we will never use a not builtin package:

Linux:

```
python3 somethingElse.py
```

Windows:

```
py somethingElse.py
```

## 😄 About me.

I'm on the third semester.
